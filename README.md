- âš¡ Fun fact: A kugelblitz is a theoretical astrophysical object predicted by general relativity.
                It is a concentration of heat, light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped.
                  In other words, if enough radiation is aimed into a region of space, the concentration of energy can warp spacetime so much that it creates a black hole.
                    This would be a black hole whose original massâ€“energy was in the form of radiant energy rather than matter
